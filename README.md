# Customer_Churn_Analysis_and_Strategy
## Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns and devising strategies to mitigate attrition rates. By leveraging advanced analytics techniques in Excel, DAX, and Power BI, we examine customer subscription data, churn indicators, and service usage patterns. Through insightful analysis, we aim to develop proactive retention strategies that enhance customer loyalty and maximize revenue.

## Exploration and Analysis Approach:
Using advanced Excel features, DAX measures, and Power BI visualizations, we dissect customer churn data to identify key drivers and predictors of churn. We analyze subscription histories, churn indicators, and customer behaviors to forecast churn probabilities and uncover actionable insights. By applying predictive modeling techniques and segmentation strategies, we develop targeted retention initiatives to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Insights Explored:
* Churn Patterns: Customers with Two-Year contracts exhibit long-term commitment, while Month-to-Month contract customers pose a higher churn risk, indicating the need for targeted retention efforts.

* Churn Impact: A significant number of customers are at risk of churn, with associated yearly charges of $16.06 million and monthly charges of $456.12 thousand, underscoring the financial implications of churn.

* Service Usage: Many churned customers did not opt for essential services such as Online Security, tech support, or Phone Services, suggesting opportunities for upselling and service bundling.

* Recommendations: Strategies include promoting longer-term contracts, offering incentives for Month-to-Month subscribers, and educating customers on the value of additional services to enhance retention rates.
